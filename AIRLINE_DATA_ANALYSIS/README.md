# Airline Data Analysis

## Overview

The airline industry generates extensive data from flight schedules, passenger bookings, airport operations, and aircraft management. This project aims to analyze airline data to uncover insights that can enhance operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and financial performance. By leveraging data analytics, we can identify trends, predict delays, and optimize airline services.

## Business Problem

The airline industry deals with vast amounts of data related to bookings, flights, airports, and customer interactions. Efficient data analysis is essential for optimizing flight schedules, enhancing customer experience, and improving operational efficiency. This project aims to leverage data analytics to extract meaningful insights from airline data, helping in decision-making processes.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Data Extraction and Processing**: Load and preprocess airline data from an SQLite database.
2. **Visualization of Insights**: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to present key findings through interactive visualizations.
3. **Total Revenue Analysis**: Calculate and analyze the total revenue generated from ticket sales.
4. **Aircraft Bookings by Class**: Analyze booking trends for different classes (Economy, Business, First Class).
5. **Aircraft with Long Range**: Identify aircraft that have a range of more than 6000 km.
6. **Ticket Booking Trends**: Determine the number of tickets booked on each date to understand demand fluctuations.

## Features

- **Data Retrieval**: Extract data from an SQLite database.
- **Data Visualization**: Present key insights through charts and graphs.

## Data Sources

The analysis is conducted on multiple tables stored in an SQLite database, including:

- `aircrafts_data`: Information on aircraft types and specifications.
- `airports_data`: Data on airports and their locations.
- `boarding_passes`: Details of passengers boarding flights.
- `bookings`: Passenger booking records.
- `flights`: Flight schedules, statuses, and details.
- `seats`: Availability and allocation of flight seats.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQLite** (Database for storing airline data)
- **Colab**

## Key Insights

- Identified key factors contributing to flight delays.
- Analyzed passenger booking trends to optimize pricing and scheduling.
- Evaluated seat occupancy rates to improve airline efficiency.
- Examined revenue trends and potential pricing optimizations.
- Determined operational inefficiencies affecting flight turnaround times.
- **Total Revenue Generated**: Calculated overall revenue from ticket sales.
- **Aircraft Bookings by Class**: Identified trends in bookings across Economy, Business, and First Class.
